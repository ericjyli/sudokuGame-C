# sudoku-gameC-program

Sudoku is a game on a 9*9 board. With the existing numbers on the board, the player has to fill the grid with numbers from 1-9 to ensure that there are not repetitive numbers in each row, column, and subgrid. 
This program uses backtracking to generate a 99 grid filled with legal numbers, and remove several numbers randomly for the players to figure out. 
Players can enter the numbers (1-9) and the row and column letter (A-I) to fill the grid. If the move is illegal, an error message will display.
The colors of the pre-filled numbers and the player-filled numbers appear differently to make it convenient to later change the filled numbers.
After the grid is completely filled with legal numbers, a win message will be delivered.
